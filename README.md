## Objectives
Using a small dataset from U.S. Census Database in 1994, I will demonstrate how a machine learning pipeline is implemented, in building a model for predicting adult income based on individual characteristics. The attached slides and Python codes will showcase the following:
- Exploratory data analysis for understanding the data and features selection
- Data pre-processing techniques
- Various machine learning algorithms and hyperparameters tuning
- Model performance measures for model selection
- Explainable AI methods that helps to understand how and why the ML model makes certain predictions

## Values
Machine learning techniques are useful in many business cases, for example:
- Predicting purchase/non-purchase likelihood
- Predicting customer churn
- Predicting credit default
- Predicting getting illness
- Predicting machine failure

..Many many more.
