# Adult-Income-Prediction
A demo on application of predictive analytics on a U.S. adult income dataset

### Objective
Using a small dataset from U.S. Census Database in 1994, we will demonstrate how a machine learning pipeline is implemented, in building a model for predicting adult income based on individual characteristics: 
-> Exploratory data analysis for understanding the data, data pre-processing and feature selection
-> Data pre-processing techniques
-> Various machine learning algorithms and hyperparameters tuning
-> Model performance measures for model selection
-> Explainable AI methods for determining feature importance and impact in a model and specific data point 

### Data source 
- UCI Machine Learning Repository (also available in Kaggle)
- Extraction was done by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database

### A classification model
- Prediction: Binary classification - a person having income <= 50K or >50K a year
- Features: 10+ individual characteristics such as age, education, work hours per week
