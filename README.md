# Adult-Income-Prediction
This is a demo on application of predictive analytics with a U.S. adult income dataset.

### Objective
Using a small dataset from U.S. Census Database in 1994, we will demonstrate how a machine learning pipeline is implemented, in building a model for predicting adult income based on individual characteristics. The attached slides and codes will showcase the following:
- Exploratory data analysis for understanding the data, data pre-processing and feature selection
- Data pre-processing techniques
- Various machine learning algorithms and hyperparameters tuning
- Model performance measures for model selection
- Explainable AI methods for determining feature importance and impact in a model and specific data point 

### A classification model
- Prediction: Binary classification - a person having income <= 50K or >50K a year
- Features: 10+ individual characteristics such as age, education, work hours per week
